     The prototypical example of a discrete dynamical system is the logistic map, which describes the dynamics of a population in terms of a reproduction rate, \(r\). At any particular iteration, \(n\), we can define the ratio of the population to the systemâ€™s carrying capacity as \(x_n\), a value between 0 and 1.
       </p>
      \[ x_{n+1} = r * x_n (1 - x_n)\]
      <p>
        Intuitively, the reproduction rate tends to increase the population. However, the model accounts for resource scarcity through the factor \((1 - x_n)\), which decreases linearly with the population. As a result, the population tends to increase linearly as \(x_{n+1} \approx r * x_n \) for small populations. As the population approaches the carrying capacity ( \( x_n \sim 1 \) ), the resource scarcity factor approaches 0, driving the population towards 0.
      <center><h6>Orbits and Cobweb Plots</h6></center>
      <p>
 We can describe the trajectory that the system takes from some initial condition \(x_0 \) by looking at the set of values the system covers. This set \( \{x_0, x_1, x_2, ... \} \) is a particular orbit.
</p>
      
       <p>  
         For 1-dimensional maps, such as the logistic map it can be easy to determine if a particular orbit diverges, converges towards a particular value (or cycle of values), or does something else by tracing the orbits under iteration. The cobweb plot is a common visual representation for the orbits of 1-dimensional systems. The basic structure of the algorithm is as follows:
       </p>
      <p>
        \(1\). Plot the line \(y = x\) and the map \(f\) as \(y = f(x)\). <br> 
        <br> 
        \(2\). Note the fixed points found where the line \(y = x\) intersects \(f\). The values of these fixed points are invariant under the map \(f\). An orbit that arrives here will not leave.<br>
        <br> 
        \(3\). Draw a vertical line from the initial condition to the curve \(y=f(x)\). This line starts at \(
        \left(x_0, 0 \right)
        \) and leads to the point \(
        \left(x_0, f(x_0) \right)
        \). <br> <br> 
       \(4\). Draw a horizontal line from the point on \(f(x)\) from step 3 to the line \(y = x\). This line starts at \(
        \left(x_0, f(x_0) \right)
        \) and leads to \(
        \left(f(x_0), f(x_0) \right)
        \)<br> <br> 
        \(5\). Draw a vertical line from the value \(\left(f(x), f(x)\right)\) on the line \(y = x \) towards the map \(f\). The point we land on here is \( \left(f(x), f(f(x))\right) \).<br><br> 
        \(6\). Repeat on from step 4.<br><br> 
        To produce a cobweb plot using <a href="https://github.com/0dannyboi/0dannyboi.github.io/blob/master/1d_discrete_dynamical.py">my code</a>, I define an instance of my class 'discrete_map'. The string expression representing the discrete map is passed as the first argument. The string representing our variable being mapped and a parameter of the map are passed as the second and third arguments:
        <pre>
  <code>
    from 1d_discrete_dynamical import*
    s = discrete_map("a * x * (1 - x)", "x", "a")
    ani = s.cobweb_animation(2.7, 100, 0.2)
    '''
    ani takes the arguments:
    (parameter, number of iterations, initial condition)
    '''
  </code>
</pre>
       Using the above parameters,
    the following animation is produced:
    <br><br>

      </p>
      <center><h6>Features of Orbits</h6></center>
      <p>
        From the cowbeb plot above for \( x_{n+1} = 2.7 x_n (1 - x_n) \) for \( x_0 = 0.2 \), we can see that the orbit appears to converge around the fixed point on the right side. For the logistic map, we can show that for  a > 0, there will be two fixed points. Using the instance \(s\) defined above, we can find the two fixed points:
                <pre>
  <code>
    In: s.fixed_points()
    Out: [0, (a - 1)/a]
  </code>
</pre>
  If the Sympy solver cannot find an analytic solution, it will return the value 'False'.
<br><br>
Expanding the map \(f(x)\) order around a value \(q\), we find that:
  \[f(x) \approx f(q) + f'(q)*(x-q) + \mathcal{O}(x-q)^2 \]

Consider an iterate of a map \(f\), \(x_n\), close to a fixed point \(x_f\) such that |\(x_n\) - \(x_f\)| is much less than 1. Terms of order \(  \mathcal{O}(x-x_f)^2 \) will be negligible. Using the linear expansion, we find:
  \[ x_{n+1} \approx  x_f + f'(x_f)*(x_f - x_n)\]
If the separation between the values \(x_n\) and \(x_f\) is initially |\(x_n - x_f\)|, the separation after one iteration is:
  \[ |x_{n+1} - x_f| \approx |f'(x_f)*(x_n - x_f)| \]
As a result, after one iteration, the separation between the value and fixed point will be the previous separation times the absolute value of the derivative of the fixed point. If |\(f'(x)\)| is strictly less than 1, orbits near \(x_f\) are drawn closer, whereas orbits near \(x_f\) are pushed away if |\(f'(x)\)| is strictly greater than 1.
 
The animation above suggests that the fixed point on the right (\(x \approx 0.6296\)) is attracting or stable. By computing the derivative, we find that:
                <pre>
  <code>
    In: f_prime = s.derivative
        d = (f_prime.subs(s.variable, s.fixed_points()[1]))
        d.subs(s.parameter, 2.7)
    Out: -0.7000
  </code>
  </pre>
We can also expect initial conditions starting near 0 to be pushed away for these parameters, as \(f'(0) = a > 1\).
<br><br>
This is exactly what we see when we set the initial condition as \(x_0 = 0.02\):
  <br><br>

The cobweb plot allows us to visualize the orbits on the logistic map for a particular initial condition and parameter. On the other hand, a bifurcation diagram shows how the long term behavior of the logistic map across varying values of the parameter \(a\).
 The following algorithm provides a method of producing a bifurcation diagram:
 <br><br>
  \(1.\) Define a set of parameters \( \{a_0, a_1, ... a_N \}\) that form the x-axis.
  <br><br>
  \(2.\) Chose an initial condition, \( x_0 \).
<br><br>
 \(3.\) For each parameter, iterate \(M\) times from \(x_0\) and plot the final \(m\) values on the y-axis.
  <br><br>
  Using the 'discrete_map' instance \(s\) above, it is straightforward to generate a bifurcation diagram. Here, I show the bifurcation diagram using 200 values of \(a\) from 0 to 4. The initial condition is \(x_0 = 0.2\) and the plot shows the final 90 iterations out of 500 for each value of \(a\).
  \[\text{s.bifurcate(0, 4, 500, 90, 0.2)}\]
 The following (annotated) plot is the result:
