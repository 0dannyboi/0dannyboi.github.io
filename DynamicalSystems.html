         Dynamical systems is the branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of a system under the repeated application of a set of rules. Some example use cases include: modeling the population of an ecosystem containing predators and prey, describing the set of configurations a double pendulum can occupy, and modeling the convection of a fluid being heated.
</p>
      <p>
	In the most rudimentary cases, we can place a dynamical system into one of two groups based on how the system evolves over time. If the changes occur in countable steps such that the configuration at a step or iteration, \(x_i\),  determines the configuration of the following iteration, \(x_{i+1}\), the system is discrete. If we cannot divide the behavior of the system into discrete steps, the dynamics are continuous. In such a case, the evolution of the system is typically modeled by differential equations.

      <center><h6>Discrete Dynamical Systems</h6></center>
      <p>
 Some of the simplest dynamical systems take the form of discrete recurrence relations, where the value at some integer step, \(x_n\), depends on the value at the previous integer step, \(x_{n - 1}\). A common definition that uses this notation is the factorial function defined over the non-negative integers:

      </p>
      \[(n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n! \]
      <p>
Where \(0!\) is defined as \(1\). Starting from this value, it is easy to define the factorial function for the consecutive integers:
        \[ 1! = 0! * 1 = 1 * 1 \xrightarrow{} 1 \text{, } \] 
        \[ 2! = 1! * 2 = 1 * 2 \xrightarrow{}2 \text{, } \]
       \[ 3! = 2! * 3 = 2 * 3 \xrightarrow{} 6 \text{ ...} \]
</p>
      
       <p>  
         The prototypical example of a discrete dynamical system is the logistic map, which describes the dynamics of a population in terms of a reproduction rate, \(r\). At any particular iteration, \(n\), we can define the ratio of the population to the systemâ€™s carrying capacity as \(x_n\), a value between 0 and 1.
       </p>
      \[ x_{n+1} = r * x_n (1 - x_n)\]
      <p>
        Intuitively, the reproduction rate tends to increase the population. However, the model accounts for resource scarcity through the factor \((1 - x_n)\), which decreases linearly with the population. As a result, the population tends to increase linearly as \(x_{n+1} \approx r * x_n \) for small populations. As the population approaches the carrying capacity ( \( x_n \sim 1 \) ), the resource scarcity factor approaches 0, driving the population towards 0. Further pages investigate the logistic map's dynamics, showing a range of rich features including chaos.

      <center><h6>Continuous Dynamical Systems</h6></center>
      <p>
        A simple  continuous dynamical system can be realized by considering a pendulum consisting of a mass, \( m \), suspended on a massless rod of length \(L \). The equations of motion can be obtained by computing the Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L} = T - U\) and evaluating the Euler-Lagrange equation:
        \[ \frac{d }{d t} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} \]
 
 Where the kinetic energy of the system is:
        \[ T = \frac{m L^2}{2} \dot{\theta}^2 \]
 
 and the potential energy of the system is:
        \[ U = m g L (1 - \cos(\theta)) \]
 
The equation of motion of the system becomes:
        \[ \ddot{\theta} = - \frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) \]
We can rewrite this second order differential equation as a coupled set of first order ODEs:
        \[\frac{d \theta}{d t} = \dot{\theta} \]
        \[\frac{d \dot{\theta}}{d t} = - \frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) \]
Further pages show how this representation  allows us to visually represent the dynamics of this system.
