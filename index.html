      <p>    
          I strongly believe that computational modeling is an indispensable tool to cement one's understanding of physical phenomena and  
          mathematical concepts. Before I started learning Python, I viewed coding as a tool that was only accessible to developers maintaining a website
          or the software engineers keeping my laptop running. I also pictured research in physics as being a cross-talk between experimentalists and 
          theorists carefully refining models. After tinkering around with some simple code I wrote to model elastic collisions, I realized the utility of 
          computation when my velocity histograms tended towards the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution that I learned about in thermal physics. 
          Although I wasn't entirely sure of what I wanted to do with my future, I quickly realized that I wanted it to be in the overlap of computation
          and physics.
          As a result, much of this codebase contains numerical procedures in Python and Mathematica I wrote to help me gain more intuition for the
          problem sets I worked through.</p>
      <p> 
          I am also interested in computational physics as a research tool in and of itself. Not only has computation made it possible to study 
          complicated processes in exotic fields like quantum chromodynamics and numerical relativity, it has helped formalize concepts like chaos and
          ergodicity. As a result, much of the code is the numerical procedures I used as a part of research projects
          in high-energy physics as well as material science. </p>
      
       <p>  
          The rest of this page showcases code that I used to analyze data collected from labs or public data sets. These experiences provided me with
          some practice cleaning data, finding 'good' questions to investigate, and presenting findings in a concise and informative form. </p>
      
      <p>  
          The links to the right organize the projects by a general category based on content (i.e. Dynamical Systems, Quantum Mechanics) 
          and/or type of algorithm (i.e. Monte Carlo).  </p>

      <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
      <p> I graduated with a BS in physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in December 2022. 
          Along the way, I have worked on a variety of mathematical, physical, and statistical problems which challenged me
          to become more flexible with my problem-solving techniques. </p>
        
      <p> I have a passion for learning how the world around me works. To that end, I am always trying to learn how I can improve my computational 
          workflow. Previous research includes an REU with Northern Illinois University's ATLAS group comparing simulation and 
          measurements in the search for diphoton + heavy flavor production. Additional research with the Axel Hoffmann Group at UIUC simulating
          artificial spin ice.  </p>
      <p>  
          Current interests include quantum computing and magnetic materials. 
          Currently interning at Wolfram Research. Planning on studying toward a doctorate.
