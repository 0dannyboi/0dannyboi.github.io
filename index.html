      <p>    
         I believe computational modeling has been an indispensable tool in cementing my understanding of physical phenomena and mathematical concepts. 
         Before I started learning Python, I viewed coding as a tool that was only accessible to developers maintaining a website or the software engineers 
         keeping my laptop running. I also pictured physics research as a cross-talk between experimentalists and theorists carefully refining their models. 
         However, after tinkering around with some simple code I wrote to model elastic collisions, I realized the utility of computation when my velocity 
         histograms tended towards the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution that I learned about in thermal physics. Although I wasn't entirely sure what to do with my
         future, I quickly realized that I wanted it to be where computation and physics overlap. As a result, much of this codebase contains numerical procedures
        in Python and Mathematica I wrote to help me gain more intuition for the problem sets I worked through.
          
      </p>
      <p> 
          I am also interested in computational physics as a research tool in and of itself. Not only has computation made it possible to study specific results in 
          exotic fields like quantum chromodynamics and numerical relativity, but it has also helped formalize general concepts like chaos and ergodicity. 
          As a result, much of the code is the numerical procedures I used as a part of research projects in high-energy physics and material science. 
      </p>
      
       <p>  
          The rest of this page showcases the code I used to analyze data collected from lab coursework or public data sets. These experiences provided me with practice 
          cleaning data, finding 'good' questions to investigate, and presenting findings in a concise and informative form. In these cases, I focus more on algorithms and techniques.
          </p>
      
      <p>  
          The links to the right organize the projects by a general category based on content (i.e. Dynamical Systems, Quantum Mechanics) and/or type of algorithm (i.e. Monte Carlo, Backtracking).  </p>

      <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
      <p> I graduated with a BS in physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in December 2022. 
          Along the way, I have worked on a variety of mathematical, physical, and statistical problems that challenged me
          to become more flexible with my problem-solving techniques. </p>
        
      <p> I have a passion for learning how the world around me works. To that end, I am always trying to learn more: whether it is physics or
          how I can improve my computational 
          workflow. Previous research includes an REU with Northern Illinois University's ATLAS group comparing simulation and 
          measurements in the search for diphoton + heavy flavor production. Additional research with the Hoffmann Group at UIUC simulating spin wave 
          modes in a nanodot as a part of a study of
          artificial spin ice.  </p>
      <p>  
          Current interests include quantum computing, magnetic materials, and condensed matter. 
          Intern in the Wolfram|Alpha Scientific Content Department at Wolfram Research. Planning on studying toward a doctorate in physics.
